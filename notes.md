# notes from cs260

**first entry - things i learned in this assignment**
1. it is important to version control
2. merge conflicts suck
3. jumping between vscode and github can be confusing
4. setting up the environment is not my fav part
5. markdown is lowkey fun

**entry Oct 2023 - things I learned about handshakes and vim
1. google remains the goat of debugging, esp when there's an error about a public vs private key
2. vim is weird. is that how programming was done in the 1900s?
3. a single extra letter, an extra colon, an errant number - amazing how computer programs are so complex but a single extra curly boi can make the whole thing error out
4. Success, as always, feels sweet
